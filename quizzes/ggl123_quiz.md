Erosion, Transport, Weathering, Rivers

1. Explain how a difference in energy levels can lead to a change    in the grain-size of a transported sediment, both over the  course of transport and in the final sedimentary rock.

2. How does the process of exhumation (exposure of something that has been buried) lead to weathering?

3. Explain why cracks and smaller grains are more vulnerable to chemical weathering.

4. Mass-movements (landslides) can be extremely dangerous. What    can increase the risk of a landslide in a given area?

5. How can soil creep be seen at surface?

6. What causes the change in angularity of clasts (rock fragments)      in a river? Does this process have any economic effects, and if so, what might these be?

7. Explain possible causes of a change in base-level along a river profile.

8. There are a number of possible drainage patterns. Explain what geology   or topography are required to form a radial pattern and a dendritic pattern.

9. How does onion-skin weathering form, and in what rock type is it most commonly observed?

10. What is the major distinguishing feature of ephemeral (temporary) and perennial (permanent) rivers? This governs the presence or absence of water?

11. Explain why the grain-size of aeolian (wind) sediments tends to be very even, compared to rivers.
