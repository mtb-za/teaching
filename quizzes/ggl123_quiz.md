Erosion, Transport, Weathering, Rivers

1. Explain how a difference in energy levels can lead to a change    in the grain-size of a transported sediment, both over the  course of transport and in the final sedimentary rock.

2. How does the process of exhumation (exposure of something that has been buried) lead to weathering?

3. Explain why cracks and smaller grains are more vulnerable to chemical weathering.

4. Mass-movements (landslides) can be extremely dangerous. What    can increase the risk of a landslide in a given area?

5. How can soil creep be seen at surface?

6. What causes the change in angularity of clasts (rock fragments)      in a river? Does this process have any economic effects, and if so, what might these be?

7. Explain possible causes of a change in base-level along a river profile.

8. There are a number of possible drainage patterns. Explain what geology   or topography are required to form a radial pattern and a dendritic pattern.

9. How does onion-skin weathering form, and in what rock type is it most commonly observed?

10. What is the major distinguishing feature of ephemeral (temporary) and perennial (permanent) rivers? This governs the presence or absence of water?

11. Explain why the grain-size of aeolian (wind) sediments tends to be very even, compared to rivers.

12. Explain why the zone of highest velocity in a river is not always the centre of the river.

13. What governs the presence or absence of suspended loads in a river?

14. Explain why alluvial fans and deltas are similar, and what those similarities are.

15. Explain the development of meandering streams, in particular how the grain-size in a point bar changes vertically.

16. How can stream piracy affect the people living downstream of a captured stream?

17. Explain some measures that can be taken to mitigate the damage caused by floods.

18. Contrast slumping and debris flows.

19. What failure surfaces are likely in a mass-movement.

20. What controls the rate at which chemical weathering affects a particular mineral? (Assume an acidic  fluid.)

21. Explain how the thickness of a soil can be linked to a) climate of the area soil is forming in, b) age of soil formation.

22. How does latitude affect the thickness of the various soil layers?

23. What are the characteristics of a mature sediment, and what drives the development of these characteristics?
