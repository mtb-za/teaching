## Geological History

The oldest sediment in the area is a conglomerate. This is a coarse-grained sedimentary rock which implies that the depositional environment had very high energy. This was followed by 200m of sandstone, which is also a clastic sedimentary rock, but with finer grain sizes, indicating that the energy of deposition had dropped. The last rock horizon in this unit is a fine-grained sedimentary rock, either clay- or siltstone. The shale seems to be much thicker than the preceding layers, being 700m thick. This shows that the energy of deposition dropped over time, from coarse units at the base to increasingly finer units. These rocks were then lithified.

A compressional tectonic event then took place, which caused the sedimentary rocks to fold. These folds are open and symmetrical.

A period of erosion then took place, followed by the deposition of 400m of limestone above the unconformity that this erosion formed. Limestone is a chemical sedimentary rock, which requires a large amount of carbonate to be in the water.

After the lithification of the limestone, the entire sequence was tilted towards the south-west. The angle of dip is approximately 18Â°.

The entire sequence was faulted. This fault is a reverse fault with the downthrown block in the south.

After the faulting, another layer of limestone was deposited. This is thinner, being only 250m thick.

A vertical dolerite dyke was intruded through all the rocks that have been deposited. This is a mafic igneous rock, usually with medium-grained crystals. It is approximately 50m thick.

The dolerite dyke and all the rocks it intruded is in turn cut by a normal fault, with the movement being towards the north-west.

Finally, the sequence was eroded to the present-day topography.
