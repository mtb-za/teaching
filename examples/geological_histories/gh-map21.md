## Geological History of Map 21

The oldest features in the mapped area are the conglomerates that make up Horizon A. These are coarse-grained, clastic rocks, indicating deposition in a high-energy environment. A drastic drop in energy then followed, with the deposition of a shale horizon. Shale is a clastic sedimentary rock with a fine grain-size. This was followed by the deposition of a very fine-grained claystone or siltstone, indicating that the energy of deposition remained low. The final unit in this sedimentary sequence was a sandy shale. While this is mostly fine-grained, some sandy (clasts up to 2mm) sections can be seen. This indicates an increase in depositional energy.

These rocks were lithified and tilted. They now dip to the east.

At this point, Fault F1 formed. This is currently vertical, so it is not possible to determine if it formed as a result of compression or extension. Despite this, it can be seen that the western block moved down, relative to the rest of the rocks.

Following the fault, a period of non-deposition took place, forming an unconformity through erosion.

A second sequence of sedimentary rocks was then deposited. The first unit was a sandstone. This is a medium-grained clastic sedimentary rock, indicating a medium-energy depositional environment. This was followed by limestone. Limestone consists primarily of calcium carbonate, and usually requires very low-energy environments to form.

The entire sequence was then tilted, again causing a dip to the east.

Fault F2 then formed, cutting through all the rocks deposited. Again, the rocks on the western side of the fault were downthrown.

Finally, the area was eroded to the current topography.
