## Geological History of Map 31

The oldest sediment in the area is a conglomerate. This is a coarse-grained sedimentary rock that deposited in a high-energy environment. A drop in the depositional energy then occurred, with the deposition of a relatively thin layer of clay- or siltstone, which is also a clastic sedimentary rock, but much finer-grained. A thick sandstone sequence, indicating a medium- to medium-high energy environment was then deposited. A fine-grained shale (indicating a low energy depositional environment) becoming a sandy shale (low to medium energy) are the last sedimentary rocks deposited.

All of these rocks were then lithified.

The first of the igneous intrusions in the area, in the form of two dolerite sills intruded into the sandstone horizon (C). Dolerite is a medium-grained mafic rock. The lower sill is notably thicker than the upper sill. These dykes are cross-cut by two dolerite sills, which are the next event.

The entire sequence thus far was then tilted towards the south-west.

A vertical fault, running north-east to south-west formed, downthrowing the south-eastern part of the sequence by approximately 300m. This fault also appears to have offset at least one of the dolerite dykes. The fault may have occurred as a result of the same tectonic activity that caused the tilting, but this is not entirely clear.

A period of erosion followed, forming an unconformity.

Volcanic activity in the area led to the eruption of basalt, which can be seen outcropping in the northern parts of the map, above the unconformity.

Further tilting, this time to the north affected the entire sequence. This was followed by erosion to the present surface.

A granite batholith is also present in the area. Granite is a felsic igneous rock, which consists primarily of quartz and feldspar. Unfortunately, the relative age of this is not easy to determine, since there are no cross-cutting relationships with any of the events above. All that can be said about this intrusion is that it occurred at some point after the deposition and lithification of the sedimentary package (A -- E).
