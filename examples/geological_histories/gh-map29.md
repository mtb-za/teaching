## Geological History of Map 29

The rocks in this area are all sedimentary. The oldest are a thick marl horizon. Marl is a carbonaceous mudstone, which would have deposited in a low-energy environment. A sandstone, with a basal conglomerate is conformably deposited above the marl. The presence of the basal conglomerate indicates a high-energy environment, which would have dropped fairly rapidly to a medium-energy environment for the sandstone to be deposited. Another thick marl horizon was deposited, this time with a relatively thin coal seam within it. Coal is an organic-rich rock, usually made from compressed and heated plant material. Depositional energy would have needed to be relatively low for this horizon to form, which is consistent with the deposition of the marl.

These sediments were then lithified. As a result of compressive tectonism, they were then folded. The shortening was east to west, with the fold axes running north to south. There are two anticlines visible in the mapped area.

A normal fault running approximately north-north-west to south-south-east then formed as a result of extensional tectonism.

A period of erosion and non-deposition followed, creating an unconformity.

Limestone, a chemical sedimentary rock containing primarily calcium carbonate is the only rock found above the unconformity. This would have required very low-energy conditions to form.

The entire sequence was then tilted towards the north, before eroding to the present topography.
